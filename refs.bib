abstract = {{This study aims to predict the direction of US stock prices by integrating time-varying effective transfer entropy (ETE) and various machine learning algorithms. At first, we explore that the ETE based on 3 and 6 months moving windows can be regarded as the market explanatory variable by analyzing the association between the financial crises and Granger-causal relationships among the stocks. Then, we discover that the prediction performance on the stock price direction can be improved when the ETE driven variable is integrated as a new feature in the logistic regression, multilayer perceptron, random forest, XGBoost, and long short-term memory network. Meanwhile, we suggest utilizing the adjusted accuracy derived from the risk-adjusted return in finance as a prediction performance measure. Lastly, we confirm that the multilayer perceptron and long short-term memory network are more suitable for stock price prediction. This study is the first attempt to predict the stock price direction using ETE, which can be conveniently applied to the practical field.}},

The information theory measures are extracted from a Gaussian Graphical Model constructed from daily stock time series of the top 74 listed US banks. The graphical model is calculated with a recently developed algorithm (LoGo) which provides very fast inference model that allows us to update the graphical model each market day. We therefore can generate daily time series of mutual information and transfer entropy for each bank of the network. The Granger causality between the bank related measures and the financial stress indexes is investigated with both standard Granger-causality and Partial Granger-causality conditioned on control measures representative of the general economy conditions.}},

abstract = {{Expected Shortfall (ES), the average loss above a high quantile, is the current financial regulatory market risk measure. Its estimation and optimization are highly unstable against sample fluctuations and become impossible above a critical ratio r=N/T, where N is the number of different assets in the portfolio, and T is the length of the available time series. The critical ratio depends on the confidence level α, which means we have a line of critical points on the α−r plane. The large fluctuations in the estimation of ES can be attenuated by the application of regularizers. In this paper, we calculate ES analytically under an ℓ1 regularizer by the method of replicas borrowed from the statistical physics of random systems. The ban on short selling, i.e., a constraint rendering all the portfolio weights non-negative, is a special case of an asymmetric ℓ1 regularizer. Results are presented for the out-of-sample and the in-sample estimator of the regularized ES, the estimation error, the distribution of the optimal portfolio weights, and the density of the assets eliminated from the portfolio by the regularizer. It is shown that the no-short constraint acts as a high volatility cutoff, in the sense that it sets the weights of the high volatility elements to zero with higher probability than those of the low volatility items. This cutoff renormalizes the aspect ratio r=N/T, thereby extending the range of the feasibility of optimization. We find that there is a nontrivial mapping between the regularized and unregularized problems, corresponding to a renormalization of the order parameters.}},

Systemic risk and the propagation of shocks in financial markets is also a topic of great relevance that has attracted increasing attention in recent years. In the present work, we bridge the gap between these two topics with an in-depth investigation of the systemic risk structure of co-crashes in high frequency trading. We find that large co-crashes are systemic in their nature and differ from small ones. We demonstrate that there is a phase transition between co-crashes of small and large sizes, where the former involves mostly illiquid stocks, while large and liquid stocks are the most represented and central in the latter. This suggests that systemic effects and shock propagation might be triggered by simultaneous withdrawals or movement of liquidity by HFTs, arbitrageurs and market makers with cross-asset exposures.}},

This article first proposes an improved ETE method with a sliding window. We verify that this new method can capture the dynamic orders effectively by validating this method with the linear TE method. Furthermore, using the improved method, we investigate the strength and direction of information flow among economic policy uncertainty (EPU), investor sentiment and stock market by the novel concept of dynamic effective transfer entropy. The EPU and investor sentiment results show that EPU influenced investor sentiment mainly from August 2015 to June 2016. Among different policies, China's exchange rate reform policy and “circuit-breaker” policy in the stock market played an important role. Moreover, the analysis of sentiment and stock price returns shows that investor sentiment is more a reflection of changes in stock price returns with a 1-month lag order and that the stock market has a significant bargainer effect and a weaker bandwagon effect. Finally, there is no significant information flow transmission relationship between EPU and stock market volatility, indicating that stock market fluctuations are essentially not affected by national policy fluctuations. Although investor sentiment is affected by changes, such as exchange rate reform and stock market policies, many investors do not form consensus expectations.}},

With the help of Campbell’s      coding theorem, we show that the Rényi entropy selectively emphasizes only      certain sectors of the underlying empirical distribution while strongly      suppressing others. This accentuation is controlled with Rényi’s parameter      q. To tackle the issue of the information flow between time series, we      formulate the concept of Rényi’s transfer entropy as a measure of      information that is transferred only between certain parts of underlying      distributions. This is particularly pertinent in financial time series,      where the knowledge of marginal events such as spikes or sudden jumps is      of a crucial importance. We apply the Rényian information flow to stock      market time series from 11 world stock indices as sampled at a daily rate      in the time period 02.01.1990–31.12.2009. Corresponding heat maps and net      information flows are represented graphically.

However,      so far no attempts have been made to utilize the asymmetric relationship      of firms. Thus far, most papers focus on only the target firm, and few      papers focus on the target firm and relevant firms together. In this      article, we propose a novel machine learning model to forecast stock price      movement based on the financial news considering causality. Specifically,      our method analyzes the causal relationship between companies, and it      accounts for the directional impact within the Global Industry      Classification Standard sectors. In our proposed method, transfer entropy      is used to find causality, and multiple kernel learning is used to combine      features of target firm and causal firms. Based on a Korean market dataset      and out-of-sample test, our experimental results reveal that the proposed      causal analytic-based framework outperforms two traditional      state-of-the-art algorithms. Furthermore, the experimental results show      that the proposed method can predict the stock price directional movements      even when there is no financial news on the target firm, but financial      news is published on causal firms. Our findings reveal that identifying      causal relationship is important in prediction problems, and we suggest      that it is important to develop machine learning algorithms and it is also      important to find connections with well-established theories such as the      complex system theory.}},

Multivariate transfer entropy is well      suited for this task, being a model-free measure that captures nonlinear      and lagged dependencies between time series to infer a minimal directed      network model. Greedy algorithms have been proposed to efficiently deal      with high-dimensional datasets while avoiding redundant inferences and      capturing synergistic effects.

The      method was validated on synthetic datasets involving random networks of      increasing size (up to 100 nodes), for both linear and nonlinear dynamics.      The performance increased with the length of the time series, reaching      consistently high precision, recall, and specificity (>98\% on average) for      10,000 time samples. Varying the statistical significance threshold showed      a more favorable precision-recall trade-off for longer time series.
